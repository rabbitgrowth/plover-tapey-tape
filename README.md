# Tapey Tape

Tapey Tape is an alternative to Plover’s built-in paper tape.
It provides a side-by-side view of strokes and translations as well as
some extra information.

```
      |   KP   A              | {}{-|}
   ++ |      H AO E  R        | here
    + |        A  E        S  | *here's  >HAO*ERS
    + |     WH A              | what
      |  T                    | it
 ++++ |      HRAO      B G   Z| look {^s}
   ++ |      HRAO EU   B G    | like
    + |  T P H                | in
    + |    P  RA       B G S  | practice
    + |  T P          P L     | {.}
```

The bars made up of `+`s on the left show the hesitation time for
each stroke.

The hints on the right beginning with `>` are
[clippy](https://github.com/tckmn/plover_clippy)-style suggestions
that show opportunities to write words or phrases more efficiently.
In the above example, it’s telling me that the two strokes I used for
“here’s”, `HAOER/AES`, can be condensed into one, `HAO*ERS`.

Instead of displaying the paper tape in a window, Tapey Tape
outputs it to a text file named `tapey_tape.txt` in Plover’s
configuration directory:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\plover`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/plover`
- Linux: `~/.config/plover`

You can review the file afterwards or use a tool like `tail -f` to
get a real-time feed.
- Note: the flag `---disable-inotify` may be required to make the `tail` work for WSL

## Fingerspelling

Tapey Tape tries to be clever and treats contiguous fingerspelled
strokes as a group, so that when you
[fingerspell “kvetch”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIfjztBuBc8)
for example, it will only show suggestions for “kvetch”, not sub-words
like “vet”, “vetch”, “et”, “etc”, and “etch”.

```
|   KP   A              | {}{-|}

## Installation

To install this plugin, right click the Plover icon, go to Tools →
Plugins Manager, find `plover-tapey-tape`, and click “Install/Update”.
When it finishes installing, restart Plover, go to Configure → Plugins,
and check the box next to `plover-tapey-tape` to activate the plugin.

(If you don’t see the plugins manager, it may not be installed
because you’re using an older version of Plover. Please see the
[Plugins](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Plugins)
page on the Plover Wiki for instructions.)

## Configuration

You can customize the behaviour of this plugin by creating a
[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) configuration file named
`tapey_tape.json` in Plover’s configuration directory (see above).
(If you don’t create the file or don’t specify certain options,
the default values will be used.) The available options are:

- `"output_file"`: an absolute filepath specifying the file to
  output to. `~` is expanded to the home directory. Defaults to
  `tapey_tape.txt` in Plover’s configuration directory.
- `"bar_character"`: the character used to draw the hesitation bar.
  Defaults to `"+"`.
- `"bar_max_width"`: the maximum number of characters drawn.
  Defaults to `5`.
- `"bar_time_unit"`: the number of seconds each character represents.
  Defaults to `0.2`.
- `"bar_threshold"`: a constant number of seconds to subtract from the
  hesitation time of each stroke. (In other words, how long to wait
  before the clock starts ticking.) This can be used to hide the bars
  for fast strokes so that the bars for the slow strokes stand out more
  visually. Defaults to `0`.
- `"bar_alignment"`: either `"left"` or `"right"` indicating whether the
  bar should be left-aligned or right-aligned. Defaults to `"right"`.
- `"line_format"`: a string template specifying how each line in the
  output should be formatted. Special codes beginning with `%` are
  transformed into different items:

| Code | Item           | Example                                 |
|:-----|:---------------|:----------------------------------------|
| `%t` | date and time  | `2020-02-02 12:34:56.789`               |
| `%b` | hesitation bar | `+++++`                                 |
| `%S` | steno          | `...K.W.R....U.RPB......` (`.` = space) |
| `%r` | raw steno      | `KWRURPB`                               |
| `%D` | definition     | `yes{,}your Honor`                      |
| `%T` | translation    | `Yes, your Honor`                       |
| `%s` | suggestions    | `>>KWRURPB`                             |
| `%%` | an actual `%`  | `%`                                     |

The default format is `%b |%S| %D  %s`:

```
    %b |          %S           | %D      %s

  ++++ | ST        E   PB      | sten
    ++ | S K W R O             | *steno  >STOEUPB STO*EUPB
```

Here’s a comparison between `%D` and `%T`:

```
                          %D        %T

|    P H       R        | Mr.{-|}   Mr.
|    PW R O  U  PB      | brown     Brown
|      H  O EU    L   DZ| /         HOEULDZ
|          *            | *         *
|      H  O E     L   DZ| holds     holds
|        A  EU          | a         a
|    P     *    P       | {&P}      P
|      H   *            | {>}{&h}   h
|  TK      *    P       | {&D}      D
|  TK       E      G    | degree    degree
|  T P H                | in        in
|  T P H AO* U R        | {neuro^}  neuro
| S K   RAO EU  PB   S  | science   science
|  T P          P L     | {.}       .
```

In short, `%D` is the *definition* in your dictionary, including
commands like `{-|}` and `{.}`. `%T` is the *translation* by Plover,
or the actual characters that are output. (If a stroke is undefined,
`%D` is displayed as `/`.)

You can additionally specify the *minimum width* of an item by inserting
a number between the `%` and the letter code. For example, `%10r` makes
the raw steno at least 10 characters wide by padding it with spaces.
This can be used to generate a tabular output:

```json
{
    "line_format": "%10r -> %T"
}
```

```
-T         -> The
KWEUBG     -> quick
PWROUPB    -> brown
TPOBGS     -> fox
SKWRUFRPZ  -> jumps
OEFR       -> over
-T         -> the
HRAEZ      -> lazy
TKOG       -> dog
TP-PL      -> .
```

Here’s an example configuration that stretches the hesitation bar to
twice its default width:

```json
{
    "bar_max_width": 10,
    "bar_time_unit": 0.1
}
```

Note that if you edit `tapey_tape.json` while Plover is running, you’ll
have to restart Plover for the new settings to take effect.
